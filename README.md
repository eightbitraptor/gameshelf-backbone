# Gameshelf Backbone

An experimental front end client for my Gameshelf Rails API. Also my first stab at a Coffeescript/Backbone application.

built using [Middleman](https://github.com/middleman/middleman) - to get up and running you need to do the following

    gem install middleman

    cd gameshelf-backbone

    middleman server

this will start the server at `localhost:4567` which will compile all `.coffee` and shiznit on the fly.
